## Description

This repository is used to maintain my portfolio. Feel free to clone it and use it as a template for your own. I am a full stack software developer with 1+ years of experience developing web applications. My skillset includes React, Redux, Bootstrap, Express and MongoDB. In my spare time I also enjoy reading and real estate. If you would like to work together or collaborate on a project feel free to reach out to me.

## Roadmap of Future Improvement
This is my first portfolio.  I have plans in the future to upgrade it including the styling, projects and the domain.  
**Styling**
I would like to dig deeper into the overall theme and styling of my website.  I will be thinking the next few months how I can improve the design so it stands out to future employers. The projects
currently on my portfolio are very simple.  

**Projects**
I plan to create more advanced projects and add them to my portfolio as well as demonstrations so viewers can
see them directly on my portfolio without having to navigate to my Github.  

**Domain**
Last I plan to purchase my own domain.
